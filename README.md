# ARP Spoofing Simulation & Detection Project

This document outlines the steps to execute the ARP spoofing simulation, network sniffing, and the detection module.

### **Target Server Information**

  * **Target Web Server IP:** `http://34.28.24.97`

## 1\. Attacker Machine Setup (Kali Linux)

Before running the attack scripts, ensure the attacker machine is configured correctly to route traffic.

### **Prerequisites: Enable IP Forwarding**

To act as a Man-in-the-Middle, the attacker machine must forward packets between the victim and the gateway. Run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

### **Execution Steps**

Open three separate terminal windows on the attacker machine and navigate to the project directory (e.g., `/home/kali/Desktop/Network-project`).

#### **Terminal 1: Start the Sniffer**

This script will listen for and capture network packets directed at the attacker machine due to the spoofing.

```bash
sudo python3 snff.py
```

*Expected Output:*
`[*] wlan0 üzerinde dinleniyor. Tekrarlayan paketler filtrelendi.`
*(Note: The network interface, e.g., wlan0, may vary depending on your setup.)*

#### **Terminal 2: Start the Spoofer**

This script performs the actual ARP poisoning attack, telling the victim that the attacker is the router, and telling the router that the attacker is the victim.

```bash
sudo python3 spoof.py
```

#### **Terminal 3: Start Wireshark (Optional)**

For graphical analysis and verification of the packet flow, run Wireshark.

```bash
sudo wireshark
```

-----

## 2\. Victim Machine Simulation

Once the attacker is spoofing and forwarding traffic, simulate victim activity.

1.  Open a web browser on the victim machine.
2.  Navigate to the target server IP:
    **[http://34.28.24.97](http://34.28.24.97)**

*The traffic generated by accessing this site should now be flowing through the Attacker's "Terminal 1" (sniffer) before reaching the internet.*

-----

## 3\. Detector Module Execution

The detection module monitors the network for suspicious ARP activity. This can be run on the victim machine or a dedicated monitoring station.

### **Setup & Run**

Navigate to the detector directory, set up a virtual environment for dependencies, and run the script.

```bash
cd /detect

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the detector
sudo python3 detect.py

```
